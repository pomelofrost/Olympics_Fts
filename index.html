                <p>Inspired by Studio Moniker’s “Your Line or Mine” project, “Olympic Fts.” is a sport themed crowd sourced animation that means to highlight the high intensity, heavy movements and the heavy rigor of sports. Paying homage to the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics as well as sports that are usually not as prevalent in mainstream media. 
                </p>
                <p>Within each different set of sports, rules such as pre-assigned colors (that align with the rings of the olympics), pre-disposed stickers, and more scene specific things, are meant to serve as a springboard for the participants to add their own creative flair to a frame.
